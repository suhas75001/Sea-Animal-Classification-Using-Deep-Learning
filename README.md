# Sea-Animal-Classification
sea Animals Classification Using Deep Learning is a project that uses *CNN models* like DenseNet201, Xception, InceptionV3, and ResNet50V2 with *Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV* to classify 13 marine species. It aids in biodiversity monitoring, ecological research, and conservation by efficiently identifying underwater animals.

1. Collected the Sea Animal image dataset for training and testing.
2. Performed data preprocessing such as cleaning and normalization.
3. Resized all images to a uniform dimension for model compatibility.
4. Collected and implemented deep learning models (DenseNet201, Xception, InceptionV3, ResNet50V2).
5. Trained the models using the processed dataset to achieve accurate classification.
6. Developed a Flask web application to predict sea animals from uploaded images.
